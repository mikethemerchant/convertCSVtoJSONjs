problem was on the application side: the culprit process went idle without
committing the last transaction, which resulted in the culprit holding locks on
tables it had changed earlier, even through it wasn’t running any queries. This
happens when the application executes BEGIN TRANSACTION, then changes data in
tables through INSER/UPDATE/DELETE queries, and never executes COMMIT
TRANSACTION or ROLLBACK TRANSACTION. This is a bug in the application that it
allows such scenario and doesn’t have any safety process to check for such
abandoned processes and terminate them (which causes a rollback and releases
locks).</span> </p><p style=margin:0in;font-size:10pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;><span style=font-size:11.0pt;>;</span> </p><p style=margin:0in;font-size:10pt;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;><span style=font-size:11.0pt;>In incidents 1, 4, and 5,

5778,WptDevelopment,Defect Collection Upgrade,"<span>Gentlemen,<br></span><br> I had an idea I brought up in our defect meeting regarding the ability to allocate a single defect to multiple employees. I ran it by the group to hear their thoughts and there were no objections; nothing but positive feedback. ;<br> The idea is to be able to enter multiple employees for the same defect. This doesnt mean its required, only that you have an option to do so.<br> For example, many times an operator is getting hit for missing a defect during inspection and the person whos actually responsible for the defect or for not checking their own work is not, and vice versa.<br> It eliminates picking and choosing and the operators do not feel they are being singled out, when clearly both are responsible. It promotes equal accountability and fairness across the board.<br> Other benefits include, greater awareness and visibility … operators may not even be aware of a defect they had a &quot;hand&quot; in because it is allocated to someone else.<br> It promotes the importance of checking ones work, which will help to achieve our goal of eliminating all defects, without having to inflate our numbers and adding additional defects into the system.<br> Theres more but thats the basic premise.<br> Is this something that can be done or we can do? Do you see any concerns or issues from a technical standpoint?<br> Oh … I also spoke with Margie as well, because any changes will be across the board in both buildings. She loved it and gave the go ahead to see if we cant get this done. .<br> <br> Please let me know your thoughts,<br> <span>Lenny ;</span><br> ",JRLSLLC

for SMT :</span><br> You know how the stringer need
to make a “new” tray label for the trays that go in the towers on the lines?
Well, is it possible to make a program so that when they do their labels, they
look different than the labels made by the stock room? Maybe by coding them
different, like maybe adding
;letters?; I am not sure how all that
works.; This is just a suggestion.; Currently all the parts that are
in trays and sticks are at a plus discrepancy .; With some computer work,
we can determine what numbers to get rid of.; But that usually takes a bit
of time.; If they “looked” different, they could be balanced MUCH quicker
and easier. Thank You Diane D&quot; <br> &quot;Like
when I do the recat labels...there is a box noted additional
notes. This
may work to make the notation that this is a tower label and not an actual reel
label. Understand??? Lets
try this to see if this will be acceptable. <br> Tammy Stachowski :)&quot;  ",JRLSLLC

 for non-workstation ESD verifications, but its not happening and we 
need to get going and track the items: Mobile racks, Wire rack shelves, 
ESD jackets. ;I suppose one database with 3 tables is the way to go.(As 
opposed to one table with a bunch of non-applicable fields.) It needs to
 be viewable by anyone in our facilities with credentials, and trained 
people will have read-write authorization. If someone can be tasked with
 creating this, let me know and I will plan out what fields I think we 
need for each item. ;Thanks ;

                            Is this project going to take days, weeks or
 months? ;If it will be a long time, I will put the records on paper 
forms (temporarily). We have over $1000 worth of conductive wheels to 
put on carts and only 4 are done because of the risk of losing records. 
;But Ill need to get going on those and the smocks, database or no 
database. ; When the requested database is ready, someone can do data 
entry from the paper forms. If this is only going to take a week, we can
 wait. ;Also, we dont need all 3 database tables at once. ;If you can 
give us Carts, well use that, and when those are installed maybe the 
Smocks table will be ready? ;Thanks.

tablet PC with rubber protector? ;I suspect our laptop might get broken 
from carrying it around that much. ; For the Smocks testing, we will set
 up in one area and have employees go to the test cite, so a laptop 
would not be in peril. ;Alternatives to carrying a computer around are, 
log on to the nearest networked PC, OR print up paper forms and do data 
entry later.

 rack shelving, such as the ones in B3 Stockroom, or the ones that hold 
Genrad fixtures. ;These shelves might be exempt ;because they dont 
generally store &quot;unprotected ESDS&quot; product. We might not immediately 
test shelving, because it was not cited, but it is part of S20.20 and 
will be eventually cited. ;Shelving will be easier to test because they 
will nearly all pass without modification (no conductive wheel has to be
 installed).

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ve been looking at defects in Building Two since the
beginning of the month.; I have noticed that basically only Test and FQA
entries have shown up.; I spoke with Jolene Z and she said she’s also
entered defects this month. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Phil P and I did some experiments entering defects using his
and Jolene’s number.; (We used the B3073A shop order and then deleted the
entries that took.); Phil’s went in fine under the “FPI” inspection area,
but Jolene’s would not enter using “SMT PRE RELOW INSPECTION” nor using “SMT
POST REFLOW INSPECTION”.; We experimented more and found that when using
either “FPI INSPECTION” or “FQA IN PROCESS INSP”, entries could be made using
Jolene’s sign-in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(1) It looks like there is something amiss with the SMT selections
of the inspection area for Jolene.; This may affect others also because in
December I have not seen any Brandon entries and only a couple of SMT entries
in building one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(2) In the Inspection Area is it important to make a
specific selection?; Can they just choose FPI or will that mess something
else up? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This request is similar to IT Request #6883 in July 2017. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To help streamline First Articles, I will need the following
from IT. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to supply accountability for all non SMT parts
used on every assembly similar to SMT Reels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to pull information from SMT Reels and above
program for each shop order. The program would need to ; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>;;provide Reel ID and A# for each item used on the
build. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to access DMR and pull/ print C of C’s for each
Reel ID used; on a build. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to pull Reel ID, Customer P/N and description of
part, for a designated build, and populate this information </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>;;into First Article Report. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First Articles can be broken down into the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pre-start/ First process inspection – Approximately 50% of
the time required to complete First Article </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In-process inspections – Approximately 20% of the time
required to complete First Article </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Final First Article Inspection –Approximately 30% of the
time required to complete First Article </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The above programming would cut the time down for Pre-start/
First Process Inspection by approximately 20% and Final First Article
Inspection by approximately 5%. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The time required to complete First Articles could be steam
lined further by purchase of a AS91002 First Article Program. </p>

Scott Mundorff and I see this as high importance due to the fact that we have had downtime on numerous occasions ranging from 20-40 minutes and the operators skip all verification for the components if they cannot figure something out. Since there is no IT or Engineering support for this issue on the off shifts I feel this is the best option until a better solution is found.

like to have the automated test that just got approved added to this.;
This is another test that saves the data to our Test Database.; I don’t

<p class=MsoNormal><span style=color:#1F497D;>The monthly checklist for expired
materials is currently a paper checklist, as required by QP8.2.2, However a
closer look at this procedure does not spell out the details of how this form
is to be handled, that is it to “ to be returned to quality by the 3<sup>rd</sup>
day of the new month”, </span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style=color:#1F497D;>Right now no one is issuing

would like to have it added to six sigma, that way an automatic flag is

6379,WptDevelopment,"Cal database, redundant calibrations in History vsts-579","<p>Our practice of abeyance works like this: Calibration is registered, then status is changed to STORED. When Equipment is placed into service, status is changed back to OK and cycle is adjusted to make proper due date of 1 cal cycle after date placed into service. We do not touch the calendar so the actual cal date is unchanged. Unfortunately a nuisnace redundant calibration is being generated in History. The rule for a calibration is: Status must contain OK AND a date must be selected on the calendar! If we dont touch the calendar, there should be no new calibration!! </p><p>; </p><p>; </p><p>

</p><p class=MsoNormal style=margin:0in 0in 0pt;><span style=color:blue;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;font-size:14pt;>I couldn’t find the ticket, but I remember that the issue was the
History table was showing redundant calibrations of the same date and this was
the result of changing status, probably of calibrated equipment that was stored
in abeyance and later placed into service. Our practice is to change the status
from OK to STORED when the equipment is placed into abeyance. Then when ready
to use the equipment, we change status back to OK and change the cycle days to
make a due date equal to one calibration cycle after placed into service. This
resulted in the unwanted redundant calibration date in History.</span> </p><p>

all down. I think I told Derek that if we don’t click on the calendar, there
should be no calibration date added, and we don’t click on the calendar when we
bring something out of abeyance.</span> </p><p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ve been looking at defects in Building Two since the
beginning of the month.; I have noticed that basically only Test and FQA
entries have shown up.; I spoke with Jolene Z and she said she’s also
entered defects this month. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Phil P and I did some experiments entering defects using his
and Jolene’s number.; (We used the B3073A shop order and then deleted the
entries that took.); Phil’s went in fine under the “FPI” inspection area,
but Jolene’s would not enter using “SMT PRE RELOW INSPECTION” nor using “SMT
POST REFLOW INSPECTION”.; We experimented more and found that when using
either “FPI INSPECTION” or “FQA IN PROCESS INSP”, entries could be made using
Jolene’s sign-in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(1) It looks like there is something amiss with the SMT selections
of the inspection area for Jolene.; This may affect others also because in
December I have not seen any Brandon entries and only a couple of SMT entries
in building one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(2) In the Inspection Area is it important to make a
specific selection?; Can they just choose FPI or will that mess something
else up? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This request is similar to IT Request #6883 in July 2017. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To help streamline First Articles, I will need the following
from IT. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to supply accountability for all non SMT parts
used on every assembly similar to SMT Reels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to pull information from SMT Reels and above
program for each shop order. The program would need to ; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>;;provide Reel ID and A# for each item used on the
build. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to access DMR and pull/ print C of C’s for each
Reel ID used; on a build. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-A program to pull Reel ID, Customer P/N and description of
part, for a designated build, and populate this information </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>;;into First Article Report. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First Articles can be broken down into the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pre-start/ First process inspection – Approximately 50% of
the time required to complete First Article </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In-process inspections – Approximately 20% of the time
required to complete First Article </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Final First Article Inspection –Approximately 30% of the
time required to complete First Article </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The above programming would cut the time down for Pre-start/
First Process Inspection by approximately 20% and Final First Article
Inspection by approximately 5%. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The time required to complete First Articles could be steam
lined further by purchase of a AS91002 First Article Program. </p>

Scott Mundorff and I see this as high importance due to the fact that we have had downtime on numerous occasions ranging from 20-40 minutes and the operators skip all verification for the components if they cannot figure something out. Since there is no IT or Engineering support for this issue on the off shifts I feel this is the best option until a better solution is found.

like to have the automated test that just got approved added to this.;
This is another test that saves the data to our Test Database.; I don’t

<p class=MsoNormal><span style=color:#1F497D;>The monthly checklist for expired
materials is currently a paper checklist, as required by QP8.2.2, However a
closer look at this procedure does not spell out the details of how this form
is to be handled, that is it to “ to be returned to quality by the 3<sup>rd</sup>
day of the new month”, </span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style=color:#1F497D;>Right now no one is issuing

would like to have it added to six sigma, that way an automatic flag is

6761,WptDevelopment,"Cal database, redundant calibrations in History vsts-579","<p>Our practice of abeyance works like this: Calibration is registered, then status is changed to STORED. When Equipment is placed into service, status is changed back to OK and cycle is adjusted to make proper due date of 1 cal cycle after date placed into service. We do not touch the calendar so the actual cal date is unchanged. Unfortunately a nuisnace redundant calibration is being generated in History. The rule for a calibration is: Status must contain OK AND a date must be selected on the calendar! If we dont touch the calendar, there should be no new calibration!! </p><p>; </p><p>; </p><p>

</p><p class=MsoNormal style=margin:0in 0in 0pt;><span style=color:blue;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;font-size:14pt;>I couldn’t find the ticket, but I remember that the issue was the
History table was showing redundant calibrations of the same date and this was
the result of changing status, probably of calibrated equipment that was stored
in abeyance and later placed into service. Our practice is to change the status
from OK to STORED when the equipment is placed into abeyance. Then when ready
to use the equipment, we change status back to OK and change the cycle days to
make a due date equal to one calibration cycle after placed into service. This
resulted in the unwanted redundant calibration date in History.</span> </p><p>

all down. I think I told Derek that if we don’t click on the calendar, there
should be no calibration date added, and we don’t click on the calendar when we
bring something out of abeyance.</span> </p><p>
